## Introduction

The Netflix Analytics project aims to provide insights into Netflix's content library and user preferences. By leveraging data preparation, EDA, and a content-based recommender system, this project showcases how data science techniques can be applied to streaming service data to enhance user experience.

## Features

- Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing Netflix data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing data to uncover patterns and insights.
- Recommender System: Implementing a content-based recommender system using cosine similarity.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-analytics.git
cd netflix-analytics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and clean the Netflix dataset.
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Normalize and preprocess data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize data distributions and trends.
   - Analyze key metrics like genre popularity, release year distribution, and ratings.

3. **Recommender System**:
   - Build a content-based recommender system using cosine similarity.
   - Calculate similarity scores between content based on features like genres, directors, and cast.
   - Generate recommendations for users based on their viewing history.

To run the project, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```
